CS246 Group 7 project - Denis Cianko, John Cornia, Josiah Howe, and Meagan Roberts
Pocket Pantry Android App

proposal
an app to keep track of what food items and spices you already have at home. Combined with the ability to input recipes you use often our goal is for the app to tell you what else you need to purchase at the store to complete the recipe. Other possibilities include having the app search out recipes that fit what you already have in the pantry, and an alert for items you are low on. Overall, we feel this app would benefit us and provide plenty of directions to explore and stretch us in this project.   

Required Features 
The basic features of our application will be to allow a user to input the items in their ‘pantry’. The app will store and organize these items into an accessible list, which will be accessible by and easily modified by the user. The user will also be able to add recipes to a ‘recipe book’ and, hopefully, be able to import recipes from an API. The user will be able to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on both the recipe book and the pantry. 

Stretch Goals 
Our stretch goals involve a function of the app which tells the user which recipes it can currently make based on the ingredients currently in the pantry. Another feature would allow the user to select a recipe and then the app will tell them which ingredients are missing from the pantry so that they can make a shopping list. Additionally, it would be preferable if the proper unit conversions could be applied to the pantry items and if the user could easily subtract off ingredients from the pantry by merely checking a recipe as ‘made’, whereupon the app would automatically update the pantry.
